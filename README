  The cursor position functions (setpos, getpos) and the clear function (clear) in this program are my own work
because I needed something that was portable. The clear works fine and there are dozens like it floating around
the web. I have absolutely know idea what the cursor positions will do on Windows; on Linux and all the rest
they rely on ANSI Escape codes, but those aren't implemented on Windows so I used the API instead. It should
probably work, might be glitchy though.
